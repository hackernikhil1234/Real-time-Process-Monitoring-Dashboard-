🧠 Project Extension: Smart Task Manager – A Dynamic Load Balancer for Multiprocessor Systems
📌 Problem Statement:
In multiprocessor systems, uneven task distribution often leads to bottlenecks, resource wastage, and increased processing time. Traditional methods may not adapt well to dynamic workloads or asymmetric architectures. There's a need for an intelligent, adaptive, and lightweight load balancing mechanism that optimizes processor usage in real time.

🛠️ Project Overview:
This extension introduces a Dynamic Load Balancer – a real-time smart task manager that ensures efficient task distribution across all processors in a multiprocessor system. It enhances performance and prevents system slowdowns by constantly monitoring system state and reallocating workloads accordingly.

🎯 Goals:
Efficiently distribute compute, memory, and I/O-intensive tasks to appropriate processor cores.

Predict upcoming workload spikes using lightweight machine learning techniques.

Minimize task scheduling overhead while maintaining optimal performance.

Adapt to heterogeneous architectures (e.g., ARM big.LITTLE).

Reduce latency and improve thermal/power management.

🔍 Module-Wise Breakdown:
Module 1: Task Profiler
Categorizes tasks into compute, memory, or I/O intensive.

Assigns a suitability score for each processor.

Module 2: Core Manager
Detects processor type (performance vs efficiency cores).

Maps high-load tasks to high-performance cores accordingly.

Module 3: Predictive Balancer
Uses past workload trends to forecast load spikes.

Redistributes tasks preemptively to prevent overload.

Module 4: Real-Time Monitoring Engine
Tracks CPU usage, thermal status, and energy consumption.

Ensures processors do not exceed safe thresholds.

Module 5: Communication Optimizer
Reduces task migration latency between processors.

Streamlines inter-core communication.

⚙️ Functionalities:
Assigns tasks dynamically based on real-time core status.

Monitors task queues and rebalances if needed.

Provides energy and temperature-aware task scheduling.

Continuously refines allocation logic based on feedback loops.

💻 Technologies Used:
Python 3.7+

psutil – for system resource monitoring.

typing – for type hinting and code clarity.

Custom ML routines – for predictive balancing (lightweight, optional).
